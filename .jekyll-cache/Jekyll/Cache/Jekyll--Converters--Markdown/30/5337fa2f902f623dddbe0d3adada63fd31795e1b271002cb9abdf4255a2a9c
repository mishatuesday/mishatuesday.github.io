I"n<p>You’ve seen this: you click on a button and a form seems to pop up. The rest of the screen goes dark and there’s a smallish box in the center of the page with a product view, or a form to fill out, or some breakout detail that you asked for. You click ‘done’ or whatever, and the box disappears and the screen is no longer dark. THIS WAS NOT A POPUP.</p>
