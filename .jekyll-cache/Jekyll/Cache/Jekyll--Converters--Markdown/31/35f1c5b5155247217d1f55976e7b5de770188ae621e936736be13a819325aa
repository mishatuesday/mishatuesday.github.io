I"Ç<p>I actually hate the word Blogosphere, but I thought <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Hello, World!</code> would be an even worse first post title.</p>

<p><strong>TL; DR: I used to do web coding and am getting back into the industry.</strong></p>

<p>Hi, I‚Äôm Misha Tuesday, and my eclectic career cluster has professionally included, roughly in this order: potato farmer, musician, water bottling plant supervisor, database administrator, web developer, sprout farmer, truck driver, puppeteer, developmental disability advocate, clown, magician, and hypnotist.</p>

<p><em>Surprisingly, I have never had a diagnosis of ADD.</em></p>

<p>For the last several years, I‚Äôve been a self-employed solopreneur (mostly doing magic and hypnosis shows), but since performing and hypnotizing people mostly happens in-person*, the COVID-19 pandemic destroyed my business.  Yes, things are coming back, but while in career freefall I decided to get back to something I love: <em>coding</em>.  It can be done remotely, it usually pays very well, and I find it very satisfying.</p>

<p>I also find that as I get older, I get more‚Ä¶ well, not introverted exactly, but less extremely extroverted, perhaps? Anyway the idea of working from home instead of going out and being on stage has increasing appeal for me for many reasons.</p>

<p>I am attending an intensive 15-week <strong>coding bootcamp</strong> which I started on September 19, 2022.  The program I chose was <a href="https://flatironschool.com/">Flatiron School</a>‚Äôs Software Engineering program.  They teach JavaScript, React, Ruby, and Rails. <em>Side note: I previously used pre-ES6 JavaScript, CSS, HTML, PHP, several flavors of SQL, and the now-defunct Munch and Lunch (from back in my Borders.com days).</em></p>

<p>One of the requirements of the Flatiron course is to do a tech blog, so here‚Äôs episode one.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve chosen to use Jekyll for my blog, mostly because it was listed as ‚Äúif you want a challenge‚Äù in Flatiron‚Äôs course (which choice I seriously questioned for hours while having issues from my novice misuse of Git and GitHub). I‚Äôm writing this post in VSCode, and when I‚Äôm done I will figure out how to post it on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>. <em>(of course if you‚Äôre seeing this I learned what I needed to learn about Git)</em></p>

<p>The below paragraph is from Jekyll‚Äôs default first post, and I‚Äôm leaving it here so I have an easy reference of how to do links in <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/">Markdown</a>.  Unlike HTML or wiki, the URLs are not inline. They‚Äôre defined elsewhere in the document and included by reference. I‚Äôll <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">codify</code> it afterwards so you can see the raw version‚Ä¶</p>

<p>* P.S. Performing and hypnotizing can of course be done on Zoom, but if I‚Äôm gonna be sitting in front of a monitor, <strong>I‚Äôd rather be coding!</strong></p>
