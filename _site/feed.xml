I’m just documenting the method I, a newcomer to git and GitHub, used to create one.</p>

<h3 id="what-you-need">What you need:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A local shell terminal (classically bash; I use Zsh) with Ruby and Git installed. Don’t try to do this on your phone.</li>
  <li>A free GitHub account</li>
  <li>Something to say</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="create-local-site">Create local site</h3>

<p><strong>First, install Jekyll</strong>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gem install jekyll bundler</code>
If your shell doesn’t recognize <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gem</code> as a command, you need to install Ruby.</p>

<p>**Then use Jekyll to create a site: jekyll new <sitename>**
Jekyll will create a new directory that you can now `cd` into. When you `ls`, you will see a bunch of files. The parts that are immediately relevant to you are:
`_posts/<date-of-creation>-welcome-to-jekyll.markdown`
and
`_config.yml`</date-of-creation></sitename></p>

<p>The folder <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_posts</code> is where all your posts will go; the one that’s in there is Jekyll’s default post. For ease of creating your first post, I recommend just going into the default post and replacing the content with your own. But do not remove the part that says:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-markdown" data-lang="markdown"><span class="nn">---</span>
<span class="na">layout</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">post</span>
<span class="na">title</span><span class="pi">:</span>  <span class="s2">"</span><span class="s">Welcome</span><span class="nv"> </span><span class="s">to</span><span class="nv"> </span><span class="s">Jekyll!"</span>
<span class="na">date</span><span class="pi">:</span>   <span class="s">2022-10-05 11:38:45 -0400</span>
<span class="na">categories</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">jekyll update</span>
<span class="nn">---</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>That must be at the top of every post file. Of course you can change the title (and the date if you need to), but don’t change the structure.</p>

<p><strong>Creating new posts</strong>
When you want to create a new post, create a new file in the _posts/ folder using the filename scheme
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YYYY-MM-DD-&lt;title&gt;.md</code> where YYYY is the year, MM the month, and DD the day. Title can be anything; it’s just a filename; the actual post title is defined inside the Markdown file. Remember to put your header at the top:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-markdown" data-lang="markdown"><span class="nn">---</span>
<span class="na">layout</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">post</span>
<span class="na">title</span><span class="pi">:</span>  <span class="s2">"</span><span class="s">Whatever</span><span class="nv"> </span><span class="s">you</span><span class="nv"> </span><span class="s">want</span><span class="nv"> </span><span class="s">the</span><span class="nv"> </span><span class="s">title</span><span class="nv"> </span><span class="s">to</span><span class="nv"> </span><span class="s">be"</span> 
<span class="na">date</span><span class="pi">:</span>   <span class="s">2022-10-05 11:38:45 -0400</span> 
<span class="na">categories</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">jekyll update</span>
<span class="nn">---</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>For your title, the quotation marks are required. For the time, use the actual date in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS -TMZN</code> format… the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-TMZN</code> is your time zone relative to GMT. Jekyll’s first post should have yours already listed, so you can just copy that. I’m sure there’s a tool that does this header automatically, but I’m telling you how I did it as a complete newcomeer to Jekyll and GitHub.</p>

<p><strong>Testing</strong>*
It’s a good idea to see how your posts will look (and whether you did anything wrong) before publishing to GitHub. Jekyll has a live server feature that you invoke by typing:
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bundle exec jekyll serve</code></p>

<p>This assmbles your raw files into an actual web page. By default, Jekyll uses http://</p>

<p><strong>TL; DR: I used to do web coding and am getting back into the industry.</strong></p>

<p>Hi, I’m Misha Tuesday, and my eclectic career cluster has professionally included, roughly in this order: potato farmer, musician, water bottling plant supervisor, database administrator, web developer, sprout farmer, truck driver, puppeteer, developmental disability advocate, clown, magician, and hypnotist.</p>

<p><em>Surprisingly, I have never had a diagnosis of ADD.</em></p>

<p>For the last several years, I’ve been a self-employed solopreneur (mostly doing magic and hypnosis shows), but since performing and hypnotizing people mostly happens in-person*, the COVID-19 pandemic destroyed my business.  Yes, things are coming back, but while in career freefall I decided to get back to something I love: <em>coding</em>.  It can be done remotely, it usually pays very well, and I find it very satisfying.</p>

<p>I also find that as I get older, I get more… well, not introverted exactly, but less extremely extroverted, perhaps? Anyway the idea of working from home instead of going out and being on stage has increasing appeal for me for many reasons.</p>

<p>I am attending an intensive 15-week <strong>coding bootcamp</strong> which I started on September 19, 2022.  The program I chose was <a href="https://flatironschool.com/">Flatiron School</a>’s Software Engineering program.  They teach JavaScript, React, Ruby, and Rails. <em>Side note: I previously used pre-ES6 JavaScript, CSS, HTML, PHP, several flavors of SQL, and the now-defunct Munch and Lunch (from back in my Borders.com days).</em></p>

<p>One of the requirements of the Flatiron course is to do a tech blog, so here’s episode one.</p>

<p>I’ve chosen to use Jekyll for my blog, mostly because it was listed as “if you want a challenge” in Flatiron’s course (which choice I seriously questioned for hours while having issues from my novice misuse of Git and GitHub). I’m writing this post in VSCode, and when I’m done I will figure out how to post it on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>. <em>(of course if you’re seeing this I learned what I needed to learn about Git)</em></p>

<p>The below paragraph is from Jekyll’s default first post, and I’m leaving it here so I have an easy reference of how to do links in <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/">Markdown</a>.  Unlike HTML or wiki, the URLs are not inline. They’re defined elsewhere in the document and included by reference. I’ll <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">codify</code> it afterwards so you can see the raw version…</p>

<p>* P.S. Performing and hypnotizing can of course be done on Zoom, but if I’m gonna be sitting in front of a monitor, <strong>I’d rather be coding!</strong></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="jekyll" /><category term="update" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I actually hate the word Blogosphere, but I thought Hello, World! would be an even worse first post title.]]></summary></entry></feed>
