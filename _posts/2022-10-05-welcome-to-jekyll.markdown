I actually hate the word Blogosphere, but I thought `Hello, World!` would be an even worse first post title.

**TL; DR: I used to do web coding and am getting back into the industry.**

Hi, I'm Misha Tuesday, and my eclectic career cluster has professionally included, roughly in this order: potato farmer, musician, water bottling plant supervisor, database administrator, web developer, sprout farmer, truck driver, puppeteer, developmental disability advocate, clown, magician, and hypnotist.

*Surprisingly, I have never had a diagnosis of ADD.*

For the last several years, I've been a self-employed solopreneur (mostly doing magic and hypnosis shows), but since performing and hypnotizing people mostly happens in-person\*, the COVID-19 pandemic destroyed my business.  Yes, things are coming back, but while in career freefall I decided to get back to something I love: *coding*.  It can be done remotely, it usually pays very well, and I find it very satisfying.

I also find that as I get older, I get more... well, not introverted exactly, but less extremely extroverted, perhaps? Anyway the idea of working from home instead of going out and being on stage has increasing appeal for me for many reasons.

I am attending an intensive 15-week **coding bootcamp** which I started on September 19, 2022.  The program I chose was [Flatiron School][flatiron-school]'s Software Engineering program.  They teach JavaScript, React, Ruby, and Rails. *Side note: I previously used pre-ES6 JavaScript, CSS, HTML, PHP, several flavors of SQL, and the now-defunct Munch and Lunch (from back in my Borders.com days)*

One of the requirements of the Flatiron course is to do a tech blog, so here's episode one.

I've chosen to use Jekyll for my blog, mostly because it was listed as "if you want a challenge" in Flatiron's course (which choice I'm now seriously questioning as I'm having increasing issues with git). I'm writing this post in VSCode, and when I'm done I will figure out how to post it on [GitHub Pages][github-pages]. *(of course if you're seeing this that step has now been done)* *(wow, I'm having a hard time publishing because I did something wrong between my local git and GitHub--both are new to me...)

The below paragraph is from Jekyll's default first post, and I'm leaving it here so I have an easy reference of how to do links in [Markdown][markdown-guide].  Unlike HTML or wiki, the URLs are not inline. They're defined elsewhere in the document and included by reference. I'll `codify` it afterwards so you can see the raw version...

\* P.S. Performing and hypnotizing can of course be done on Zoom, but if I'm gonna be sitting in front of a monitor, **I'd rather be coding!**
