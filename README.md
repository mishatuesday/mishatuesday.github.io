# the continuing saga of trying to simultaneously learn git, GitHub, and Jekyll
# my plan is to create a whole new GitHub repo, clone it to local, add the Jekyll files I already created (which crashed and burned due to
# circumstances I should notate but don't feel like right now, then push back to GitHub. Wish me luck!
